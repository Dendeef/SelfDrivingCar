After you open the page you see the cars driving and a visual representation of the neural network on the right.

To save the best nearal network you press the 💾 button.

To remove and restart the neural network you press the 🗑️ button.

To restart the cars you press the 🔄 button.

Every time that you press the 🔄 button your latest neural network will stay the same.
